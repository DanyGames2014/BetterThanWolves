# Better Than Wolves Legacy Unofficial

## About the project

BTW:LU is a port to Station API of the original Better Than Wolves version 2.94 by FlowerChild. It has been improved with new optional features and recipe registries for most of the machines so other mods can easily add new recipes. Crossover content with other mods is another goal of this project.
