# Better Than Wolves Legacy Unofficial

## About the project

BTW:LU is a port to Station API of the original Better Than Wolves version 2.94 by FlowerChild. It has been improved with new optional features and recipe registries for most of the machines so other mods can easily add new recipes. Crossover content with other mods is another goal of this project.

## Setup

[See the StationAPI wiki.](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI/wiki)

## Common Issues

**I get "Invalid source release: 17" as an error!**  
Use Java 17. Open up `File > Project Structure` and change your SDK to Java 17.  
If you still get the issue, you may need to go into `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle` and change the Java that Gradle uses too.
